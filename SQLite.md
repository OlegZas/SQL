# What is SQLite?

SQLite is a lightweight, serverless, self-contained relational database management system (RDBMS). It is designed to be embedded into applications, meaning it doesnâ€™t require a separate server process or installation. The entire database is stored in a single file, making it portable, simple to deploy, and easy to back up. SQLite is widely used in situations where a lightweight, simple database is needed, such as in mobile apps, small desktop applications, or embedded systems.

## Key Features of SQLite:
- **Self-contained**: The entire database resides in a single file.
- **Serverless**: No separate server or daemon is required.
- **Zero-configuration**: No complex setup or configuration required.
- **ACID-compliant**: Supports transactions that are Atomic, Consistent, Isolated, and Durable.
- **Lightweight**: It is small in terms of both memory usage and disk space.

## Comparison with Other Databases

SQLite is **serverless** and **lightweight**, while **MySQL** requires a dedicated server and is better suited for larger-scale, multi-user applications. SQLite is typically used in applications with minimal concurrent database access, while MySQL is designed for web applications or services that require high concurrency, complex queries, and better scalability. SQLite is designed for embedded, local storage use cases with smaller datasets, while **BigQuery** is built for massive-scale, cloud-based data analytics. **DuckDB** is more specialized for analytical queries (OLAP) while SQLite is more general-purpose and designed for transactional workloads (OLTP).
