1️⃣ Partitioning & Clustering (Best for Large Tables)
Partition the table by a time-based column (e.g., MESSAGE_PUBLISHDATE) to reduce scanned data.
Cluster by frequently queried fields (e.g., MESSAGE_SOURCE) to improve query speed.
sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE your_dataset.your_table
PARTITION BY DATE(MESSAGE_PUBLISHDATE)
CLUSTER BY MESSAGE_SOURCE;
🔹 Benefit: Faster queries by reducing the number of scanned rows.
🔹 Use Case: If queries often filter by date or source.

🔹 Best Partitioning Strategy
Since MESSAGE_PUBLISHDATE is a time-based column, partitioning by DATE(MESSAGE_PUBLISHDATE) is ideal.

sql
Copy
Edit
CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE your_dataset.your_table
PARTITION BY DATE(MESSAGE_PUBLISHDATE)
CLUSTER BY MESSAGE_STATUS;
🚀 Why This Works Best
Partitioning by MESSAGE_PUBLISHDATE ensures only recent data is scanned instead of the entire table.
Clustering by MESSAGE_STATUS groups RECEIVED rows together within each partition, making queries like this much faster:
sql
Copy
Edit
SELECT * 
FROM your_dataset.your_table
WHERE MESSAGE_STATUS = 'RECEIVED'
AND MESSAGE_PUBLISHDATE >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY);
🔹 Benefit:
✅ Faster queries by scanning only recent partitions.
✅ Efficient filtering for MESSAGE_STATUS = 'RECEIVED'.
✅ Avoids scanning unnecessary records.

🔹 Why?
Partitioning by MESSAGE_PUBLISHDATE allows BigQuery to prune partitions, meaning it only scans relevant partitions instead of the entire table.
Filtering only by MESSAGE_STATUS = 'RECEIVED' (without a date condition) forces BigQuery to scan all partitions, making it slower.
🔹 Performance Difference
Query	Uses Partition Pruning?	Efficiency
WHERE MESSAGE_STATUS = 'RECEIVED'	❌ No (Scans entire table)	Slower
WHERE MESSAGE_STATUS = 'RECEIVED' AND MESSAGE_PUBLISHDATE >= DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE(), INTERVAL 7 DAY)	✅ Yes (Scans only recent partitions)	Faster
